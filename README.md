# Adversarial-Search

•	an AI agent in Python for a turn-based adversarial game through grid interface using grid-based discretization. 

•	a game interface that displayed the board with all of the nodes to update the board based on the player move.

•	use evaluated heuristic values for all nodes using minimax search to indicate a better move for the agent or the adversary
